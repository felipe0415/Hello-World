# Hello-World
Hi I'm 15 years old and I am from Brazil.

I speak english fluently because I lived in the united states for 3 years when I was 10 to 13 years old.

I got back to Brazil and in effect of the corona virus I decided to start trying this programming thing that I was always interested.

And I love soccer, that's it.
